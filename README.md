## Key Features
- **Subnet Mask Calculation**: Dynamically calculates the subnet mask for any IP address and CIDR.
- **Host Calculation**: Computes the total number of usable host addresses available within a subnet.
- **Subnet Examples**: Displays the first and last subnets to provide practical examples of the subnetting output.
